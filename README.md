Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968 - NATO Conference)

The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968.
The conference was held to address the "software crisis"‚Äîa period when software projects were failing due to poor planning, inefficiency, and high costs.

Established software engineering as a formal discipline with structured methodologies.
Led to the development of programming best practices, documentation standards, and systematic testing methods.
Encouraged the separation of software development from hardware engineering.
2. The Rise of Agile Development (2001 - Agile Manifesto)
What Happened?

A group of 17 software developers created the Agile Manifesto in 2001, which introduced a new way of developing software.
It emphasized flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development over rigid planning and documentation.
Impact:

Transformed software development from the Waterfall model (which had strict, linear phases) to Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban.
Improved team collaboration, faster delivery, and adaptability to changes.
Became the standard approach for modern software development.
3. The Shift to Cloud Computing and DevOps (2010s - Present)
What Happened?

The rise of cloud computing (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) allowed software to be deployed and scaled more efficiently.
DevOps (a combination of Development + Operations) emerged to automate software deployment, testing, and monitoring.
Impact:

Enabled continuous integration & continuous deployment (CI/CD), reducing the time it takes to release software.
Improved scalability and flexibility with cloud services.
Helped businesses transition to microservices and containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for efficient software management.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning
Define project goals, scope, budget, and timeline.
Conduct feasibility studies (technical, operational, and financial).

2. Requirements Analysis

Gather and document functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders.

3. Design
Create architectural designs, UI/UX mockups, and database schemas.

4. Development (Implementation)

Write the actual source code based on the design specifications.
Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage code changes.

5. Testing
Perform unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Identify and fix bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.
Use automated and manual testing methods.

6. Deployment
Deploy the software to production environments (servers, app stores, or cloud platforms).
Configure databases, servers, and networking settings.
Release in phases (e.g., beta release, full deployment) if necessary.

7. Maintenance & Support
Monitor system performance and fix bugs or security issues.
Release updates, patches, and feature enhancements.
Provide technical support for users.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
